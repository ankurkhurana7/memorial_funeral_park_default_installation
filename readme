2. I am assuming you have Apache setup and is pointing to the same directory as this source code
3. in file **sites/default/settings.php:92 change 
3. create two databases one for the default installation and other for the site1.com 
4. Go to the URL that points to this directory follow the drupal installtion select the default drupal installation profile give the database name for the  parent drupal installation.
5. Go to your dns file, in ubuntu you can find it in /etc/hosts write the alias for the ip address of the default installtion as "site1.com"
6. got to the url site1.com and select the drupal installation profile to "memorial site1" follow the steps (enter the databasename that you want to use with the site1.com)
7.Make sure that the admin theme is garland and the default theme is theme4.
8.got to the site-building -> menus -> settings change the source of the secondary links to primary links.
9.go to site-building -> blocks and put nice-menu-1 into the header block 
10. go to the configuration of the the nice-menu-1 block and change :
                                 block title to <none>
                                 manu parent to primary links
                                 menu style  to down
                                 
11. goto the site building -> themes -> configure and set path to the custom nice menus cssd file to "sites/site1.com/themes/theme4/css/nice-menu-theme4-custom.css"
